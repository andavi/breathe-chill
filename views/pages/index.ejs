        <h2>Can a Snack Help?</h2>

        <div id="nutrition-intro">

          <p class="nutri-info">Science has found that what we eat can affect our mood. So maybe choose your snacks with that in mind. Look for foods high in magnesium, zinc, B-vitamins, and Omega-3 fatty acids. Also there is strong evidence for including anti-oxidants and probiotics, a healthy gut helps with the production of serotonin, one of the "happy hormones".</p>

          <p class="nutri-info">Conversely, there are also foods that can bring us down, and increase our feelings of anxiety. Foods that quickly ramp up our system, but are often followed by a crash just as quickly.
